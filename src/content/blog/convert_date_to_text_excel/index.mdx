When handling datetime data in Excel, sometime we need to convert it to text. One simple example we do that is when we need to concatenate that with other data. In this tutorial, I will explain how to convert date to text in Excel.

## Convert Date to Text in Excel

Excel formula that can be used to convert date value to text in Excel is `TEXT` function. This functions allows you to format a date value to a specific text based on format we apply on the function.
This means, every time your data value changes, the text will also change. To stop the relation, simply copy paste value the text function.

**Warning:**  Excel recommends to keep original date data in one cell, and then use `TEXT` function in another cell. Then if you still want to use it on other formula, you can refer to the original date data.
